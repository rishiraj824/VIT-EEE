          Dream jobs are not just dreams in VIT since the 2007-8 batches. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, De Shaw have recruited students with a package of more than 10 lakhs per annum. Adding to the list: Flipkart, Intel, Akamai, Cisco, Yahoo, Oracle, Google, KLA Tencor, Dolcera have recruited the students with packages of more than Rs. 7,00,000 per annum. Indian Armed Force and Indian Navy have VIT as a nodal centre for their selection process. VIT has placement records because of PAT centre. Not only does this function as the working body to facilitate smooth working of the placement activities in the campus but also works to facilitate the training activities of the students. Giving back to the community: as part of its social outreach, VIT formed a Placement Consortium to help the engineering and science students of neighboring colleges. A noble initiative of our beloved Chancellor to help the good students studying in neighboring colleges get placed.</p>
